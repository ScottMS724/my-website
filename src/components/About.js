            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p className="fontsize20">As a graduate of Flatiron School's software engineering course, I have significant experience
            building full stack web apps with a React/Redux frontend and Ruby on Rails API backend, and using Git, SQL, RESTful API conventions, Bootstrap, 
            and Semantic UI. My goal when writing code is to prioritize readability and adaptability through the use of established 
            best practices and conventions. I enjoy finding simple solutions to common problems through code. 
            I have a B.S. in biology from Boston University and previous experience working as a professional, certified (NSCA) personal trainer and physical therapists' aide. 
            This gives me a unique background in client-facing jobs where I developed strong interpersonal skills. Combined with my technical skills honed with Flatiron, I
            believe this background to be a valuable asset in the tech world.</p>

            <p className="fontsize20">I know that software engineering is an ever-evolving field that is constantly in flux. An open, inquisive mind 
            willing to learn new things is the key to success, and I embrace the challenge.</p>

            <p className="fontsize20">When I'm not programming, my hobbies and interests include PC gaming, weight-lifting, biology, and being a podcast junkie. I'm also a
            big Mets fan. <i class="baseball ball icon"></i></p>
