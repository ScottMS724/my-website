            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>As a graduate of Flatiron School's software engineering course, I have significant experience
            building full stack web apps with a React/Redux frontend and Ruby on Rails API backend. My goal when writing code is to
            prioritize readability and adaptability through the use of established best practices and conventions. I love finding simple
            solutions to common problems through code. I have a B.S. in biology and
            previous personal training experience which I believe gives me a unique background and set of soft skills 
            to apply in the tech world.</p>

            <p>I know that software engineering is an ever-evolving field that is constantly in flux. An open, inquisive mind 
            willing to learn new things is the key to success, and I embrace the challenge.</p>

            <p>Please check out my <a href="https://scottms724.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">programming blog</a> if you would like to 
            read some of my musings on coding in general.</p>

            <p>When I'm not programming, my hobbies and interests include PC gaming, weight-lifting, biology, and being a podcast junkie. I'm also a
            big Mets fan. <i class="baseball ball icon"></i></p>
