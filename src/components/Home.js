            <h2>Hi, I'm Scott Silverman. Welcome to my website.</h2>

            <p>I'm a web developer and former personal trainer from New York.</p>

            <p>As a graduate of Flatiron School's software engineering course, I have significant experience
            building full stack web apps with a React/Redux frontend and Ruby on Rails API backend. My goal when writing code is to
            prioritize readability and adaptability through the use of best practices and conventions. I love finding seemingly simple
            solutions to common problems through code. Additionally, I believe my B.S. in Biology and
            pervious personal training experience gives me a unique set of soft skills to apply in the tech world.</p>

            <p>I know that software engineering is an ever-evolving field, constantly in flux. An open, inquisive mind willing to learn new things
            is the key to success, and I embrace the challenge.</p>
